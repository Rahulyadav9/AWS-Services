## üß© **Basic VPC Interview Questions**

### **1. What is a VPC in AWS?**

A **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)** is a logically isolated section of the AWS cloud where you can launch AWS resources (EC2, RDS, etc.) in a **custom virtual network** that you define.

---

### **2. What are the main components of a VPC?**

* **Subnets** ‚Äì Divide the VPC into smaller networks (public/private).
* **Route Tables** ‚Äì Control routing of network traffic.
* **Internet Gateway (IGW)** ‚Äì Enables communication between the VPC and the internet.
* **NAT Gateway / NAT Instance** ‚Äì Allows private instances to access the internet securely.
* **Security Groups** ‚Äì Instance-level firewall.
* **Network ACLs** ‚Äì Subnet-level firewall.
* **VPC Peering / Transit Gateway** ‚Äì Connects multiple VPCs.
* **Elastic IPs** ‚Äì Static public IP addresses.
* **DHCP Option Set** ‚Äì Configures DNS and other settings for instances.

### **3. What is the difference between a public subnet and a private subnet?**

| Type           | Internet Access                       | Typical Usage               |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Public Subnet  | Has route to IGW                      | Web servers, load balancers |
| Private Subnet | No route to IGW (may use NAT Gateway) | Databases, backend services |

---

### **4. What is an Internet Gateway (IGW)?**

An **IGW** allows communication between instances in your VPC and the internet. It must be attached to the VPC and referenced in the route table for internet-bound traffic.

---

### **5. What is a NAT Gateway and why is it used?**

* A **NAT Gateway** allows instances in a **private subnet** to connect to the internet **outbound** (for software updates, etc.) but **prevents inbound traffic** from the internet.
* It‚Äôs managed by AWS, unlike a NAT instance.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Intermediate VPC Interview Questions**

### **6. How does routing work in a VPC?**

Each subnet is associated with a **route table** that defines how traffic is directed.
Example routes:

* `10.0.0.0/16 ‚Üí local` (for internal traffic)
* `0.0.0.0/0 ‚Üí IGW` (for internet)
* `10.1.0.0/16 ‚Üí Peering connection` (for inter-VPC communication)

### **7. Difference between Security Group and Network ACL (NACL)?**

| Feature     | Security Group         | Network ACL            |
| ----------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Level       | Instance level         | Subnet level           |
| Stateful    | ‚úÖ Yes                  | ‚ùå No                   |
| Rules       | Allow only             | Allow & Deny           |
| Evaluation  | Applied after NACL     | Applied before SG      |
| Typical Use | Protect individual EC2 | Control subnet traffic |

---

### **8. Can you have multiple subnets in one Availability Zone?**

‚úÖ Yes. You can create multiple subnets in one AZ (e.g., one public, one private) for separation of concerns.

---

### **9. What is VPC Peering?**

**VPC Peering** connects two VPCs privately using AWS backbone ‚Äî no internet access needed.
Used for communication between different accounts, regions, or environments (like Dev ‚Üî Prod).

---

### **10. What are VPC Endpoints?**

Allow private connections from your VPC to AWS services **without using the internet**.
Types:

* **Interface Endpoint (ENI-based)** ‚Üí For most AWS services.
* **Gateway Endpoint** ‚Üí For S3 & DynamoDB only.

---

## üîí **Advanced VPC Interview Questions**

### **11. What is a Transit Gateway (TGW)?**

A **Transit Gateway** connects multiple VPCs and on-prem networks through a central hub, simplifying large architectures compared to many VPC peering connections.

---

### **12. What is a VPN connection in AWS?**

A **VPN connection** securely connects your on-prem network to AWS VPC via an **IPSec tunnel**, typically over the internet.

---

### **13. What is Direct Connect?**

**AWS Direct Connect** establishes a dedicated **private network connection** between your on-premises data center and AWS for lower latency and higher bandwidth.

---

### **14. What is the difference between NAT Gateway and Bastion Host?**

| Feature    | NAT Gateway                               | Bastion Host                           |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Purpose    | Allow private instances outbound internet | Secure SSH access to private instances |
| Managed by | AWS                                       | You                                    |
| Direction  | Outbound only                             | Inbound (admin access)                 |
| Protocols  | All outbound                              | SSH/RDP                                |

---

### **15. Can you connect two VPCs in different AWS regions?**

‚úÖ Yes, using **Inter-Region VPC Peering** or **Transit Gateway**.

---

### **16. How to connect on-premises data center to AWS VPC?**

You can use:

1. **Site-to-Site VPN** (IPSec)
2. **AWS Direct Connect**
3. **Transit Gateway + VPN**
4. **Hybrid approach (VPN + DX)** for redundancy

---

### **17. How do you make a subnet public?**

* Attach an **Internet Gateway (IGW)** to the VPC.
* Update the subnet‚Äôs **route table** with a route to the IGW (e.g., `0.0.0.0/0 ‚Üí igw-xyz`).
* Assign a **public IP** or **Elastic IP** to instances.

---

### **18. What happens if you don‚Äôt attach an Internet Gateway to your VPC?**

Instances in that VPC **cannot access the internet**, even if they have public IPs.

---

### **19. What are Elastic Network Interfaces (ENI)?**

ENIs are **virtual network cards** attached to EC2 instances.
They allow:

* Multiple IPs per instance
* Multiple private/public IPs
* Enhanced network failover

---

### **20. What‚Äôs the difference between default and custom VPC?**

| Feature         | Default VPC      | Custom VPC           |
| --------------- | ---------------- | -------------------- |
| Created by      | AWS              | User                 |
| Internet Access | Yes (by default) | User must configure  |
| Subnets         | One per AZ       | User-defined         |
| Use Case        | Quick launch     | Production isolation |

---

## üß† **Scenario-Based Questions**

### **21. You have a private EC2 instance that needs to download updates ‚Äî how?**

Use a **NAT Gateway** in a public subnet and update the private subnet‚Äôs route table to point `0.0.0.0/0 ‚Üí NAT Gateway`.

---

### **22. You want to connect 10 VPCs together ‚Äî what‚Äôs the best approach?**

Use **AWS Transit Gateway** instead of VPC peering (which becomes complex after a few connections).

---

### **23. How can you secure communication between VPCs?**

* Use **VPC Peering / Transit Gateway** (private)
* Apply **Security Groups + NACLs**
* Use **PrivateLink / VPC Endpoints**

---

### **24. What CIDR blocks are allowed for a VPC?**

CIDR range between `/16` (65,536 IPs) and `/28` (16 IPs). Example: `10.0.0.0/16`.

---

### **25. How do you troubleshoot VPC connectivity issues?**

1. Check **route tables**
2. Check **security groups**
3. Check **NACL rules**
4. Verify **IGW/NAT** attachments
5. Use **VPC Flow Logs** for network traffic debugging

Would you like me to make this into a **PDF cheat sheet** (well-formatted, categorized for interviews)?
It can include diagrams for subnet routing and peering too.
