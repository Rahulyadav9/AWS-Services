* **Terminate** ‚Äì Shut down and delete instance + attached volumes.
* **Reboot** ‚Äì Restart instance without data loss.

---

## **6. Monitoring & Management**

* **CloudWatch** ‚Äì Monitor metrics (CPU, network, disk, status checks).
* **CloudTrail** ‚Äì Track API calls and changes.
* **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)** ‚Äì Distribute traffic among instances.
* **Auto Scaling** ‚Äì Automatically adjust the number of instances.

---

## **7. Security Best Practices**

* Use **IAM roles** for access control.

Here‚Äôs a **comprehensive EC2 interview Q&A guide** (from basics ‚Üí advanced ‚Üí scenario-based).

## üöÄ **AWS EC2 Interview Q&A**

### **1. Basics**

**Q:** What is Amazon EC2?
**A:** EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity (virtual servers) in the cloud. You can run applications without investing in physical servers.

**Q:** What are the different types of EC2 instances?
**A:**

* **General Purpose** ‚Äì Balanced (e.g., T, M family).
* **Compute Optimized** ‚Äì CPU-heavy (C family).
* **Memory Optimized** ‚Äì RAM-heavy (R, X family).
* **Storage Optimized** ‚Äì High IOPS (I, D family).
* **Accelerated Computing** ‚Äì GPU/FPGA (P, G family).

**Q:** What are EC2 pricing models?
**A:**

1. **On-Demand** ‚Äì Pay per second/hour, flexible.
2. **Reserved Instances** ‚Äì 1 or 3-year commitment, cheaper.
3. **Spot Instances** ‚Äì Bid for unused capacity, cheapest but can be interrupted.
4. **Savings Plans** ‚Äì Flexible usage commitment.
5. **Dedicated Hosts/Instances** ‚Äì Physical servers for compliance.

---

### **2. Storage**

**Q:** What‚Äôs the difference between EBS and Instance Store?
**A:**

* **EBS (Elastic Block Store):** Persistent, survives stop/start.
* **Instance Store:** Temporary, data lost if instance stops/terminates.

**Q:** Types of EBS volumes?
**A:**

* gp3/gp2 (General Purpose SSD)
* io1/io2 (Provisioned IOPS SSD)
* st1 (Throughput Optimized HDD)
* sc1 (Cold HDD)

---

### **3. Networking**

**Q:** What is an Elastic IP in EC2?
**A:** A static IPv4 address that you can associate with an instance. Unlike public IPs, Elastic IPs persist across stop/start.

**Q:** What‚Äôs the difference between Security Groups and NACLs?
**A:**

* **Security Groups:** Instance-level, stateful, allow rules only.
* **NACLs:** Subnet-level, stateless, allow + deny rules.

**Q:** How do you connect to an EC2 instance?
**A:**

* Linux: SSH using `.pem` key pair.
* Windows: RDP using `.pem` + Administrator password.

---

### **4. Scaling & Load Balancing**

**Q:** What is Auto Scaling in EC2?
**A:** Automatically adjusts the number of EC2 instances based on demand. Works with CloudWatch alarms.

**Q:** How do Load Balancers work with EC2?
**A:** Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) distributes incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances for high availability.

---

### **5. Security**

**Q:** How do you secure sensitive credentials in EC2?
**A:**

* Don‚Äôt hardcode credentials.
* Use IAM roles for EC2.
* Use AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store or Secrets Manager.

**Q:** What happens if you lose the `.pem` key for an EC2 instance?
**A:**

* Stop the instance, detach its root volume.
* Attach the volume to another instance.
* Add a new public key to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file.
* Reattach and start the instance.

---

### **6. Monitoring & Troubleshooting**

**Q:** How do you monitor an EC2 instance?
**A:** Use **CloudWatch Metrics** (CPU, Network, Disk), **CloudWatch Logs**, and enable **Detailed Monitoring**.

**Q:** An EC2 instance is unreachable (can‚Äôt SSH). What steps would you take?
**A:**

1. Check Security Group (port 22 open).
2. Check NACL rules.
3. Verify correct key pair.
4. Ensure the instance has a public IP / Elastic IP.
5. Check if the OS-level firewall is blocking access.

---

### **7. Advanced / Scenario-Based**

**Q:** How do you migrate an on-premise application to EC2?
**A:**

* Use AWS **Server Migration Service (SMS)** or **Application Migration Service (MGN)**.
* Create AMIs and launch equivalent EC2 instances.

**Q:** You need **zero downtime deployment** on EC2, how would you achieve it?
**A:**

* Use **Auto Scaling Group** + **Load Balancer**.
* Deploy new version to new instances ‚Üí switch traffic gradually.
* Or use **Blue/Green Deployment** with Route 53.

**Q:** Your EC2 bill is too high. What steps would you take to optimize cost?
**A:**

* Use **Reserved Instances** or **Savings Plans**.
* Use **Spot Instances** for non-critical workloads.
* Right-size instances (monitor CPU/memory).
* Turn off unused instances.

**Q:** How do you achieve high availability with EC2?
**A:**

* Launch instances across **multiple AZs**.
* Place them behind an **ELB**.
* Enable **Auto Scaling**.

**Q:** How do you back up data from EC2?
**A:**

* Create **EBS snapshots** (incremental backups).
* Use **Amazon Machine Image (AMI)** for whole-instance backup.
* Sync files to **S3**.
