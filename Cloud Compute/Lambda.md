Got it 👍
Here’s a list of **important Node.js + AWS Lambda interview Q&A** that often come up in real interviews:

---

### **Basic Questions**

1. **What is AWS Lambda?**

   * AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that runs code without provisioning or managing servers. You only pay for execution time and requests.

2. **Why is Node.js commonly used with Lambda?**

   * Node.js is lightweight, event-driven, and has fast cold start times compared to languages like Java. It’s great for APIs, event processing, and integrations.

3. **What are Lambda triggers?**

   * Services/events that invoke a Lambda function (e.g., API Gateway, S3, DynamoDB Streams, EventBridge, CloudWatch).

---

### **Node.js in Lambda**

4. **How do you handle async operations in Node.js Lambda?**

   * Use `async/await` or return Promises. Avoid using callbacks with async/await together.
     Example:

   ```js
   exports.handler = async (event) => {
     const data = await getData();
     return { statusCode: 200, body: JSON.stringify(data) };
   };
   ```

5. **What is the role of the `callback` parameter in Node.js Lambda?**

   * It is used in the older Lambda model to send back responses or errors. Now `async/await` (Promise-based) is preferred.

6. **How do you manage dependencies in a Node.js Lambda?**

   * Use `package.json` and `node_modules`. Minimize dependencies to reduce cold start times. Use Lambda Layers for shared libraries.

---

### **Performance & Best Practices**

7. **How to reduce cold starts in Node.js Lambda?**

   * Keep packages small, use provisioned concurrency, avoid heavy initialization outside the handler, and use Lambda Layers.

8. **How to improve API performance in Lambda with Node.js?**

   * Connection pooling (for DBs), caching (e.g., Redis), async processing, and batching requests.

9. **What is the maximum package size for Node.js Lambda?**

   * 50 MB (zipped, direct upload), 250 MB (unzipped), and 3 GB via container images.

10. **What is the Lambda timeout and max memory?**

    * Timeout: 15 minutes max.
    * Memory: 128 MB to 10,240 MB.

---

### **Integration & Deployment**

11. **How does Lambda integrate with API Gateway using Node.js?**

* API Gateway forwards HTTP requests to Lambda. Lambda parses the event and returns a response with `statusCode`, `headers`, and `body`.

12. **What is a Lambda Layer?**

* A way to share common code/libraries across multiple Lambdas without duplicating `node_modules` in each function.

13. **How do you deploy a Node.js Lambda function?**

* Methods: AWS Console, AWS CLI (`aws lambda create-function`), SAM (Serverless Application Model), CDK, or Serverless Framework.

14. **How to connect Node.js Lambda to a database (RDS, DynamoDB, MongoDB)?**

* For RDS: use connection pooling with RDS Proxy.
* For DynamoDB: use `aws-sdk` DynamoDB DocumentClient.
* For MongoDB: use Atlas with VPC Peering or Lambda + private VPC.

---

### **Error Handling & Logging**

15. **How do you log in a Node.js Lambda?**

* Use `console.log()`. Logs go to **CloudWatch Logs** automatically.

16. **How do you handle errors in Node.js Lambda?**

* Throw errors or return an error response.

```js
if (!event.userId) {
  throw new Error("Missing userId");
}
```

17. **How to retry failed Lambda executions?**

* Depends on the trigger:

  * **SQS/EventBridge** → automatic retries.
  * **API Gateway** → no retries, client must retry.

---

### **Advanced / Tricky**

18. **Difference between context object and event object in Node.js Lambda?**

* `event`: contains input (API request, S3 event, etc.).
* `context`: contains metadata (request ID, timeout, function name).

19. **How do you secure a Node.js Lambda?**

* Use IAM roles with least privilege, API keys/JWT for APIs, environment variables (KMS encrypted), and VPC for DB access.

20. **How do you handle environment variables in Lambda?**

* Configure in Lambda console/CLI. For sensitive values, encrypt with KMS or use AWS Secrets Manager.

21. **What is provisioned concurrency in Lambda?**

* Keeps functions initialized and warm to avoid cold starts, useful for latency-sensitive APIs.

Perfect 👍 you already know the basics, so let’s dive into **hard and scenario-based Node.js Lambda Q&A** (these are the type of questions interviewers use to test real-world knowledge):

---

## 🔥 **Scenario-Based Node.js + AWS Lambda Q&A**

### **1. Database Connections**

**Q:** You have a Lambda function in Node.js that connects to an RDS MySQL database. After some time, the function fails with `too many connections`. How would you fix it?
**A:**

* Don’t create DB connections inside the handler on every invocation.
* Use connection pooling outside the handler and reuse connections.
* Use **RDS Proxy** to manage pooled connections efficiently.

```js
// Bad ❌
exports.handler = async (event) => {
  const conn = await mysql.createConnection(...);
  const rows = await conn.query("SELECT * FROM users");
  return rows;
};

// Good ✅
let conn;
exports.handler = async (event) => {
  if (!conn) {
    conn = await mysql.createConnection(...); // Initialized once
  }
  return conn.query("SELECT * FROM users");
};
```

---

### **2. Cold Starts in High Traffic APIs**

**Q:** Your Node.js Lambda API (behind API Gateway) has random latency spikes. How do you solve it?
**A:**

* The spikes are due to **cold starts**. Solutions:

  * Enable **Provisioned Concurrency** for critical endpoints.
  * Keep code lightweight (remove unused packages).
  * Use smaller Node.js runtime versions (e.g., Node.js 18 instead of 16 if supported).
  * Preload dependencies outside the handler.

---

### **3. Long Running Tasks**

**Q:** A video processing task takes ~20 minutes, but Lambda has a max timeout of 15 minutes. How do you handle it?
**A:**

* Offload long tasks to **Step Functions**, **ECS Fargate**, or **Batch**.
* Lambda just triggers the workflow and returns immediately.
* For video: Store in **S3 → S3 Event → Step Functions → ECS for processing**.

---

### **4. Handling Spikes in Requests**

**Q:** Your Node.js Lambda connected to DynamoDB is failing under sudden 10K requests/sec traffic. How do you handle it?
**A:**

* Use **DynamoDB auto-scaling** or **on-demand mode**.
* Implement **SQS between API Gateway and Lambda** to buffer requests.
* Batch DynamoDB writes using `batchWriteItem`.

---

### **5. File Upload with Lambda**

**Q:** How do you upload large files (>10MB) via Lambda?
**A:**

* Don’t send large files directly through Lambda.
* Instead:

  * Client requests **pre-signed S3 URL** from Lambda.
  * Client uploads directly to S3 using that URL.
  * Lambda may then process via **S3 event trigger**.

---

### **6. Error Handling**

**Q:** Your Lambda (Node.js) is triggered by SQS. Some messages fail repeatedly and keep retrying forever. How do you fix it?
**A:**

* Configure a **Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)** for failed events.
* Use **Lambda Destinations** (on failure → send to SNS/SQS).
* Add **try/catch** and structured logging in Node.js.

---

### **7. Lambda + API Gateway Response Mapping**

**Q:** You call your Lambda API but the client always gets `502 Bad Gateway`. Why?
**A:**

* API Gateway expects a structured response:

```js
exports.handler = async () => {
  return {
    statusCode: 200,
    headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
    body: JSON.stringify({ message: "Hello" })
  };
};
```

* If you return just an object (`{ message: "Hello" }`), API Gateway breaks → 502.

---

### **8. Security**

**Q:** How do you store and use sensitive credentials (DB password, API keys) in Node.js Lambda?
**A:**

* Never hardcode. Options:

  * Use **Environment Variables** (encrypted with KMS).
  * Use **AWS Secrets Manager**.
  * Use **AWS SSM Parameter Store**.

---

### **9. Concurrency Issues**

**Q:** Two Lambdas triggered simultaneously update the same DynamoDB record, causing race conditions. How do you handle it?
**A:**

* Use **Optimistic Locking** with DynamoDB `ConditionExpression`.
* Or use **SQS FIFO queue** to ensure sequential execution.

---

### **10. Lambda Deployment**

**Q:** Your Node.js Lambda exceeds the 50MB zipped package size limit. How do you deploy it?
**A:**

* Use **Lambda Layers** for common dependencies.
* Use **AWS ECR (container image)** → up to 10 GB.
* Bundle only production dependencies (use `npm prune --production`).

---

### **11. Event Ordering**

**Q:** You need to process user transactions in order. How do you ensure Lambda executes them sequentially?
**A:**

* Use **SQS FIFO Queue** (guaranteed order + deduplication).
* Attach Lambda as the consumer.

---

### **12. Reusing Node.js Code Across Lambdas**

**Q:** You have 20 Lambdas that all use the same utility functions. How do you manage code duplication?
**A:**

* Create a **Lambda Layer** with shared utils.
* Or publish a private **NPM package** and import in each Lambda.

---

### **13. API Gateway → Lambda Latency**

**Q:** Your API Gateway + Node.js Lambda is taking 2–3 seconds latency. How do you debug?
**A:**

* Check for:

  * Cold start latency.
  * VPC networking overhead (move out of VPC unless needed).
  * External DB latency (use RDS Proxy / DynamoDB).
  * Log execution time with `console.time() / console.timeEnd()`.

---

### **14. Step Functions + Lambda**

**Q:** A workflow has 5 Lambdas. If one fails, the workflow should retry 3 times before failing. How do you design it?
**A:**

* Use **AWS Step Functions** with retry policy in state machine definition:

```json
"Retry": [{
  "ErrorEquals": ["States.ALL"],
  "IntervalSeconds": 2,
  "MaxAttempts": 3
}]
```

---

### **15. Event-Driven Microservices**

**Q:** You need to build an event-driven system where an order is placed → send email → update DB → notify analytics. How would you design with Node.js Lambda?
**A:**

* Use **SNS or EventBridge**:

  * `OrderPlaced → SNS → multiple Lambda subscribers (Email Lambda, DB Lambda, Analytics Lambda)`.
* Keeps services decoupled and scalable.
